The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is a widely known personality classification system that categorizes individuals into 16 distinct personality types based on preferences across four axes:

Introversion (I) vs. Extroversion (E)
Intuition (N) vs. Sensing (S)
Thinking (T) vs. Feeling (F)
Judging (J) vs. Perceiving (P)
Each personality type is represented by a unique combination of these preferences. For example, someone with preferences for Introversion, Intuition, Thinking, and Perceiving would be classified as INTP. These classifications are often used in various fields such as research, business, psychology, and even for entertainment.

The MBTI is based on Jungian typology, a model of eight cognitive functions proposed by Carl Jung. While its scientific validity and reliability have been questioned in recent years, MBTI remains a popular tool for understanding human behavior and preferences.
Project Goal
This project leverages a dataset containing information about people’s MBTI types and their last 50 tweets, separated by "|||". The objective is to identify patterns in the text and use them to build a predictive model that can classify a person’s MBTI type based on their writing style. This exploration also serves to assess the MBTI's validity in analyzing and categorizing behavior through language.
